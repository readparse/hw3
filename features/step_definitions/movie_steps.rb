# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.


Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    m = Movie.create(movie)
  end
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.content  is the entire content of the page as a string.
  flunk "Unimplemented"
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  rating_list.split(/\s*,\s*/).each {
    |i|
    if uncheck
      uncheck("ratings_#{i}")
    else 
      check("ratings_#{i}")
    end

  # HINT: use String#split to split up the rating_list, then
  #   iterate over the ratings and reuse the "When I check..." or
  #   "When I uncheck..." steps in lines 89-95 of web_steps.rb
end

Then /I should see all of the movies/ do
